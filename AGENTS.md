# AGENTS.md — Smoky Peak ERP Portal (SPS Portal 2.0)

This is the engineering handbook for any AI agent (Cursor, Claude, or otherwise) working in this repo. Read it before making structural changes. It is the long-form version of `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — those files are the fast-recall summary; this file has the reasoning behind each rule.

Two other docs matter: `claude/project-context.md` (why this exists, the two-year vision, reference platforms) and `claude/ARCHITECTURE.md` (the target layered architecture). Both describe where this is *going*. This file describes where it *is right now* — Phase 1, a solo build, real money and real customer data on the line. When a target doc and this file disagree, this file wins, because it reflects the actual code.

---

## 0. Why the guardrails are strict

This is being built by one person (Ryan) with a real services company's operational and customer data running through it, without the budget of the ERP vendors it's competing with (ServiceTitan, BuildOps, etc.). There is no team to catch a bad migration, no ops staff to notice a leaked customer record, no QA pass before it hits production. The guardrails in this file substitute for that team. Treat them as load-bearing, not as style preferences. When in doubt, do the more conservative thing and say why in the PR/commit, don't guess.

---

## 1. What this is

Smoky Peak Services LLC is a multi-division contractor and short-term-rental service company. This portal is its internal ERP: staff/admin operations, field jobs, scheduling, and (eventually) estimating, billing, and job costing.

**Current state (2026-07-19): dashboard shell + materials catalog (CRUD + Excel import/export).** A full jobs/tickets/schedule/CRM buildout existed and was deliberately reverted — see §2a. Don't assume any feature area beyond sign-in, the dashboard, account, and materials exists until it's rebuilt.

Divisions as currently modeled in `src/config/company.ts` (the single source of truth for company/division/branding — edit only that file for those changes):

- **Integrated Systems** — low-voltage, access control, security, structured cabling.
- **Cabin Services** — STR property maintenance and quick-turn support.

Two things described in `claude/project-context.md` are **not yet in code**: the **Trash Valet** division and the **STR Magic** marketplace integration. Don't build against them as if they exist — if a task implies one of them, flag it rather than inventing the missing piece.

---

## 2. Current phase and deliberate non-goals

Per the project `README.md`: this is a login + dashboard shell baseline (Field Ops rebuilt next). The following are explicitly **not built yet, on purpose** — don't add them speculatively even though `claude/project-context.md` describes them as the eventual target:

- No custom Tennessee tax engine, de-minimis logic, or use-tax accruals.
- No Stripe invoice push or payments Lambda.
- No QuickBooks Online sync.

The eventual contract (once this phase lands) is: **Stripe Tax is the single calculator at charge time; the portal only classifies line-item tax codes; QuickBooks stays a downstream AP handoff.** Don't build a second, competing estimate-time tax authority before that classification layer is stable. If a task seems to require billing/tax logic, that's a signal to check with the user before building it — this area has a documented history of scope creep and fabricated dependencies (see `claude/project-context.md` §10, "do not use" list).

---

## 2a. The reset: why Job and Ticket got ripped out

A first pass built `Job` and `Ticket` as two separate top-level entities (a `Ticket` could optionally attach to a `Job`, `Ticket.jobId String?`). That repeated a mistake from a previous, unrelated build: a service ticket got created first and a job attached to it later, when the ticket should have been the job from the start. That two-step "ticket, then attach a job" shape is explicitly what to avoid this time.

On 2026-07-19 the jobs/tickets/schedule/CRM buildout was reverted back to a dashboard-only shell (checkpoint commit `a2caa11`, message "Checkpoint: full field-ops build (jobs/tickets/schedule/CRM) before reset to dashboard-only shell" — the old code is fully recoverable from git history if any of it is worth salvaging, but treat it as reference only, not a base to build on). What survived the reset: auth, sessions, permissions scaffolding, company config, device-surface (mobile/desktop) plumbing, the ops/PII database split and its client libraries, the public lead-ingest endpoint, and the erasure-purge stub.

**The rebuild plan going forward is piece by piece, tested at each step, in this order:** quoting/estimating first, because it drives almost everything else (it's the entry point that should create the operational work item directly, ServiceM8/ServiceTitan-style — one work-order entity, no separate ticket-to-job conversion step).

**Schemas now match that baseline:** ops `prisma/schema.prisma` is auth + org only (no `Job`/`Ticket` residue). PII keeps lead ingest (`Division`, `Lead`, `Activity`, `IngestKey`); CRM `Customer` / `Contact` / `ServiceLocation` were dropped until that phase. Don't resurrect the old two-entity Job/Ticket shape when building the new work-order model unless the user asks for it back.

## 3. Stack

- **Runtime**: Node 24 (see `.nvmrc` / `package.json` `engines`) — don't assume Node 20/22 behavior.
- **Next.js 16** App Router, **React 19**, **TypeScript 5**, **Tailwind 3** (+ `tailwindcss-animate`, `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`).
- **Prisma 7** with the `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter, against **two separate Neon Postgres databases** (see §5 — this is the most important architectural fact in the repo).
- **Better Auth** (`better-auth`) — invite-only email/password, no public sign-up.
- **Zod 4** for schema validation, **react-hook-form** + `@hookform/resolvers` for forms.
- **Luxon** for all date/time handling, localized to `company.timezone`.
- PWA: installable, service worker registers in production only (see `src/components/pwa-register.tsx`, `src/app/manifest.ts`).

---

## 4. Architecture: as-built vs. target

`claude/ARCHITECTURE.md` describes a target layering: `app/` (thin UI) → `server/` (tRPC routers) → `services/` (all business logic) → `lib/` (infra clients), plus `functions/` for Lambda event consumers. **None of `server/`, `services/`, or `functions/` exist in this repo, and there is no tRPC.** Do not create them or introduce tRPC unless the user explicitly asks for that migration — it's a real plan for later, not a mistake to silently "fix" now.

What's actually here, in `src/`, post-reset (§2a) plus materials catalog:

- **`app/(portal)/<area>/`** — pages (App Router, server components). Keep thin: call a feature function, render the result. Areas today: `account`, dashboard (`page.tsx`), and `materials` (admin catalog CRUD).
- **`features/<domain>/`** — where the real logic lives, one folder per domain. Today: `materials` (catalog EAV), `accounting` (schema-guard test), `auth`, `cron`, `ingress`. Jobs/tickets/schedule/crm were removed in the reset (§2a) and return later (quoting next). Domain shape:
  - `actions.ts` — `"use server"` Server Actions. Every exported action follows the same order: `requireUser()`/`requireArea(area)` first, then `schema.parse(raw)`, then the Prisma call(s), then `revalidatePath(...)` for every route that shows the changed data.
  - `schemas.ts` — Zod schemas shared between the server action and the client form.
  - `components/` — feature-specific UI.
- **`lib/`** — infra clients and cross-cutting helpers, no business rules:
  - `prisma.ts` — ops DB client.
  - `prisma-pii.ts` — PII DB client (lazy proxy, see §5).
  - `auth.ts` — Better Auth configuration.
  - `session.ts` — `getSession`, `requireUser`, `requireArea` (see §6).
  - `device-surface.ts`, `get-server-surface.ts`, `require-desktop.ts` — mobile vs. desktop routing (see §7).
- **`config/`** — `company.ts` (company/division/feature-flag source of truth) and `permissions.ts` (roles + area access rules).
- **`proxy.ts`** — the edge auth gate. This repo's equivalent of `middleware.ts` (Next 16 naming). Checks only for a session cookie's presence and redirects to `/sign-in`; it does not check roles. Update `PUBLIC_PREFIXES` here when adding a new unauthenticated route (e.g. a new public API endpoint).
- **`components/ui/`** — shared UI primitives (shadcn/Radix style, kept minimal — currently badge, button, input, label, textarea).

---

## 5. The ops/PII database split (read this before touching any schema)

This is the single most important — and most fragile — architectural decision in the codebase, and it exists for a real legal reason: **customer identity data (name, email, phone, address) must be isolable and erasable independently of operational data**, to make right-to-erasure and data-minimization actually achievable instead of aspirational.

**Two databases, two Prisma schemas:**

| | Ops DB | PII DB |
|---|---|---|
| Schema | `prisma/schema.prisma` | `prisma/pii/schema.prisma` |
| Client | `src/lib/prisma.ts` → `prisma` | `src/lib/prisma-pii.ts` → `prismaPii` |
| Owns | `User`, `Session`, `Account`, `Verification`, `Division`, `DivisionMembership`, `Invitation`, materials catalog (`Material*`) | `Division` (replicated), `Lead`, `Activity`, `IngestKey` |
| Deferred | Field Ops / work-order models | CRM `Customer`, `Contact`, `ServiceLocation` |
| Env vars | `OPS_DATABASE_URL`, `OPS_DIRECT_URL` | `PII_DATABASE_URL`, `PII_DIRECT_URL` |
| Generate | `npm run db:generate` | `npm run db:generate:pii` |
| Migrate | `npm run db:migrate` | `npm run db:migrate:pii` |

`Division` is replicated into the PII database (same `id`, no FK) so PII rows can reference a division without crossing the boundary; run `npm run sync:divisions-pii` after any ops migration that touches `Division` rows. There is no cross-database Prisma relation.

**The rule: never add a PII-identity column (name, email, phone, street address) to the ops schema.** This is mechanically enforced by `src/features/accounting/ops-pii-schema-guard.test.ts` (`npm run test:schema-guard`), which greps the ops schema for forbidden field names and asserts PII still owns lead ingest (and not deferred CRM models). Run it after touching either schema. When ops rows later need customer display data, batch-fetch from `prismaPii` and merge in memory — don't add a cross-DB relation.

**The PII database is not guaranteed to be configured.** On Vercel, PII access is meant to go through AWS Secrets Manager (`CLIENT_DB_SECRET_ARN`), which per the README is **not wired yet**. Because of this, `isPiiConfigured()` (in `prisma-pii.ts`) must be checked before relying on `prismaPii`, and every caller must degrade gracefully — never let a missing PII config throw and 500 the page. `src/features/ingress/lead-handler.ts` returns a `503` with `reason: "pii_unconfigured"` rather than throwing; match it in new code.

**Public lead intake** (`POST /api/v1/leads`, handled by `handleLeadIngest` in `src/features/ingress/lead-handler.ts`) writes directly into the PII database. It authenticates via a per-division `IngestKey` (hashed, checked against `x-ingest-key`) or a shared server secret (`INGEST_SERVER_SECRET` against `x-ingest-secret`) — treat this endpoint as public-internet-facing and validate accordingly; `proxy.ts` already restricts it to `POST`/`OPTIONS`.

**Right to erasure**: retention windows live in `company.retention` (`customerArchiveYears`, `leadArchiveYears`). `src/features/cron/purge-run.ts` is currently an intentional no-op stub documenting the erasure path (today: closed leads past the cutoff; later: archived customers and related ops rows by string id match). It is not wired to a real cron yet. Don't implement the real deletion logic without checking with the user first — this is exactly the kind of code where a bug deletes real customer data.

---

## 5a. Materials catalog (ops)

Foundation for quoting. Ops-only EAV taxonomy — no customer PII, no tax calculation, no part numbers on items.

Hierarchy: `MaterialDomain` (scoped to `divisionId` + `Segment`) → `MaterialCategory` → `MaterialItem`, with global `MaterialAttribute` / options assigned to categories via `MaterialAttributeAssignment`. Units live in `MaterialUnit` (seeded: EACH, FT, BOX, ROLL).

Tax classification is metadata only — no Stripe Tax API, no amount calculation, no use-tax accrual in this phase.

- **`StripeTaxCode`**: seeded reference table from `claude/prompts/samples/product_tax_codes.csv` (~673 codes). Category/item `stripeTaxCodeId` are nullable FKs (searchable combobox in admin forms), not free text.
- **`taxProfile`**: `REAL_PROPERTY` | `TPP`. New categories default to **`REAL_PROPERTY`** (installed systems). Explicit TPP carve-outs (when present): software/licenses, patch cables, servers, workstations, hard drives — per Ryan’s classification (informed by *SES v. Roberts*; see `claude/prompts/05-materials-tax-code-linkage.md`), not as settled sales-tax law.
- **`taxReviewed`**: on `MaterialCategory`; existing rows are **not** bulk-reclassified when the default changes. Walk `/materials/categories?taxReview=1` deliberately.
- Resolve material code with `resolveItemTaxClassification` (item → category → null; never invent a code).
- **Labor codes**: `WorkContext` (`INSTALL` | `SERVICE`) + `LaborTaxCodeDefault` + `resolveLaborTaxCode` in `tax.ts` (item labor override → category labor override → default table → null). Nothing consumes `WorkContext` yet (no jobs/quotes). Computer-repair override (`txcd_20080010`) is set manually via category/item labor service FK when reviewing TPP computer categories.
- Same `taxProfile` will later inform both customer-facing tax codes and contractor use-tax on realty materials — remittance tracking is out of scope here.

`MaterialCategory.requiresManualPartNumber` flags that future quote lines must collect a real part number; do not add `partNumber` / manufacturer to `MaterialItem`.

Admin UI: `/materials` (desktop-only, `requireArea("materials")` — admin + staff). Feature code: `src/features/materials/`. Write-time validation rejects attribute values not assigned to the item's category and rejects missing required attributes.

### Import / export (Excel)

Round-trip Excel for a **Division + Segment** scope via `/materials/import-export` and `GET /api/materials/export`:

- Workbook: one sheet per domain name; category blocks = title row → literal header `description | unit | laborUnits | laborUnitNotes` → items → blank separator. Empty categories (header, zero items) are valid.
- Scope code (e.g. `IS_COM`) is derived from `company.divisions[].code` + segment abbrev; filename `catalog_{SCOPE}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.xlsx` only pre-fills a guess.
- Matching uses whitespace-normalized names (`normalizeName` / slugify). Item uniqueness is `@@unique([categoryId, name])`.
- Upsert only: create missing domains/categories/units/items; update item when unit/laborUnits/laborUnitNotes differ; **never delete** rows absent from the file.
- **Layout gate:** a sheet with no category title→`description` header match is skipped (sheet-level warning) and does **not** create a domain. If zero sheets match, preview/commit report a clear “doesn't look like a materials catalog export” result (blocks commit). This prevents attribute-list workbooks from creating garbage domains.
- Flow: `previewMaterialsImport` (admin/staff, no writes) → `commitMaterialsImport` (**admin only**, re-parses file, single `$transaction`).
- Fixture for ground-truth counts (5 domains / 115 categories / 102 items): `claude/prompts/samples/catalog_IS_COM_2026-07-08.xlsx` — drop the file there when available; unit tests use a synthetic workbook until then (`npm run test:materials-io`). Wrong-file regression uses a synthetic attribute-lists shape (same idea as `attribute-lists-2026-06-24.xlsx`).

### Attribute list import / export (Excel)

Same page (`/materials/import-export`, second section) and `GET /api/materials/attributes/export`. Pure logic in `attribute-io.ts` / `attribute-io-actions.ts` (not overloaded into catalog `io.ts`).

- Workbook: index sheet `Attribute Lists` (`list_key | list_name | filter_mode`) + one sheet per `list_key` (`label | sort_order | tags | rfq_contact | rfq_email`).
- Mapping: `list_key`→`MaterialAttribute.slug`, `list_name`→`name`, `inputType=SELECT`; option `label`→label, `value=slugify(label)`, `sort_order`→`sortOrder`.
- **Ignored columns (intentional):** `filter_mode` (filtering is per-assignment `isFilterable`, not on the attribute); `rfq_contact` / `rfq_email` (vendor/RFQ out of catalog scope); **`tags`** (legacy option↔category visibility tags — **no model yet**; do not invent a schema as a side effect of import — decide later if worth a join/tag design).
- Upsert by attribute `slug` and option `(attributeId, value)`; never delete missing rows. Layout gate rejects files without a valid index / list_key rows (blocks catalog workbooks from creating fake attributes).
- Flow: `previewAttributeListsImport` → `commitAttributeListsImport` (**admin only**, re-parse, `$transaction`).
- Fixture ground truth: `claude/prompts/samples/attribute-lists-2026-06-24.xlsx` → 6 attributes / 134 options (`npm run test:materials-attribute-io`).

### Delete

Hard delete (not soft/`isActive`) lives in `src/features/materials/delete-actions.ts`, wired on list pages:

- **Safe delete** (default): refuse with a clear error if children exist (domain→categories, category→items, unit→items). Empty rows delete cleanly.
- **Force delete** (domains/categories, admin only): cascade after typing the entity name to confirm.
- Items: any materials-area user may delete. Domains/categories/units: admin only.

Import upsert and UI delete are separate: missing Excel rows are never removed by import.

---

## 6. Auth & permissions

Better Auth (`src/lib/auth.ts`) handles sign-in only — invite-only, no public sign-up, 1-hour session with a 5-minute update window. Roles: `admin | staff | sales | field` (`src/config/permissions.ts`, mirrored in the ops `Role` enum). Area access is governed by `AREA_ROLES` + `canAccess()` — change access there, never with an inline role check in a page or action. Areas today: `dashboard`, `materials` (admin/staff), `settings`. Add an area key per feature as it's rebuilt.

Every Server Action's first line is `requireUser()` or `requireArea(area)` from `src/lib/session.ts`. This does two jobs at once: it's the actual permission gate, and it returns the acting `SessionUser` used for audit fields (`createdById`, `byId` on status-change events). Client-side role checks — hiding a nav item, disabling a button — are UX convenience only. A user can always call a Server Action directly, so the server-side check is the one that matters and must be present even when the UI already hid the option.

`proxy.ts` is the outermost gate and is deliberately shallow: it checks for a session cookie's presence, nothing more, and redirects unauthenticated requests to `/sign-in`. Don't move role/area logic into it.

`Invitation` (ops schema) models the invite-only flow: `email`, target `role`, `divisionIds[]`, single-use `token`, `expiresAt`. `canInvite(actorRole, targetRole)` in `permissions.ts` governs who can invite whom — admins can invite anyone, staff can invite staff/field, sales can only invite sales, field can invite no one.

---

## 7. Mobile vs. desktop surfaces

One codebase serves both. `src/lib/device-surface.ts` defines `isDesktopOnlyPath()` and `MOBILE_FALLBACK_ROUTE`. `/materials` and children are desktop-only; `MOBILE_FALLBACK_ROUTE` is `/`. Server-side, `getServerSurface()` (`get-server-surface.ts`) infers surface from `Sec-CH-UA-Mobile` or the `sps_surface` cookie, defaulting to desktop. Desktop-only server components call `requireDesktopSurface(pathname)` (`require-desktop.ts`) to redirect mobile sessions away. Client-side, `use-device-surface.ts` does the same by viewport width (`MOBILE_MAX_WIDTH = 768`).

Navigation visibility is driven by `src/config/nav.ts` (`navSections`, each `NavItem` carries `roles` and `surface: "mobile" | "desktop" | "both"`), filtered by `filterNavForRole()`. If you add a new desktop-only or mobile-only route, register it in both `device-surface.ts` (for the redirect) and `nav.ts` (for visibility) — they are not derived from each other.

---

## 8. Conventions

- New domain logic goes in `src/features/<domain>/`, in the `actions.ts` + `schemas.ts` + `components/` shape (§4). Don't call Prisma directly from a page component.
- Validate every Server Action input with its Zod schema (`schema.parse(raw)`) before touching the database. Never treat a client payload as pre-validated, even from your own form.
- All dates/times go through Luxon, localized to `company.timezone` (currently `America/New_York`).
- After a mutating action, `revalidatePath(...)` every route that displays the changed data — list view, detail view, and any mobile/field-visible surface for that domain. Check sibling actions in the same file for the full revalidation set before assuming you've covered it.
- Formatting: Prettier + `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` auto-sorts Tailwind class order — don't hand-order classes. Run `npm run format`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run lint` before considering a change done.
- No em dashes in generated copy, docs, commit messages, or anything customer-facing. House style, no exceptions.

---

## 9. Environment variables and secrets

Four files, four purposes (see `README.md` for the full table):

- `.env.local` — local secrets, gitignored. Includes `PII_*` and seed vars. Never commit.
- `.env.vercel` — synced to Vercel, gitignored. Must **not** contain raw `PII_DATABASE_URL`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, or Upstash credentials yet.
- `.env.vercel.example` — key-name template, safe to commit.
- `.env.example` — documented key names, safe to commit.

Key naming: `OPS_DATABASE_URL`/`OPS_DIRECT_URL` (ops DB), `PII_DATABASE_URL`/`PII_DIRECT_URL` (PII DB, local-only until `CLIENT_DB_SECRET_ARN` is wired), `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`/`BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `INGEST_SERVER_SECRET` (optional shared secret for the lead-ingest endpoint), `SEED_ADMIN_*` (local seed only). Never invent a new env var name without checking `.env.example` first — the naming convention (`OPS_` / `PII_` prefix) is how the two-database split stays legible in config.

Secrets never live in code or get committed in an env file. Production secrets are meant to move to AWS Secrets Manager as the PII wiring completes — don't work around that by hardcoding a fallback.

---

## 11. Guardrails, consolidated

- Stripe will be the billing source of truth when billing is built; QuickBooks will be downstream-only, one direction, event-triggered. Not built yet — see §2.
- Never compute tax in application code, now or later — classify line items, let Stripe's tax engine calculate.
- STR Magic is a separate company and codebase. Never share a database, auth boundary, or secrets with it, if/when that integration is built.
- Never add a PII-identity column to the ops schema (§5). Run `npm run test:schema-guard` after any schema change.
- Every Server Action starts with `requireUser()`/`requireArea()` (§6).
- No secrets in code or committed env files (§9).
- No em dashes in generated copy, docs, or customer-facing text.
- AI-driven features (if/when added) draft and extract only — nothing bills, sends, or commits without human approval.
- Don't rebuild Job and Ticket as two separate top-level entities with a ticket-to-job attach step (§2a). The target shape is one work-order entity, created directly by quoting/estimating.
- When `claude/ARCHITECTURE.md` or `claude/project-context.md` describes something that isn't in the code yet, treat it as the plan, not the present — build against what's actually here, and say so if a request assumes the target state already exists.

---

## 12. Where to look for more

- `claude/project-context.md` — full scope, stack rationale, reference platforms/repos, build order.
- `claude/ARCHITECTURE.md` — target layered architecture and worked request traces.
- `claude/prompts/` — scoped build prompts for each rebuild phase, in order (`01-materials-catalog.md`, `02-materials-import-export.md`, `03-materials-import-fix-and-delete.md`, `04-materials-attribute-list-import.md`, `05-materials-tax-code-linkage.md`, `06-materials-labor-tax-override-ui.md`). Read the next-numbered prompt before starting the next phase of the rebuild. `claude/prompts/samples/` holds real fixture files (prior-build exports, plus the real Stripe `product_tax_codes.csv`) referenced by these prompts — use them as actual test data, not just as descriptions.
- `README.md` — quick-start, env file table, current portal routes.
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — the same guardrails as short, glob-scoped Cursor rules.
